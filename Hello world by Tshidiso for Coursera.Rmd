# This is the second R Markdown document for Data Science Coursera
## Introduction

This piece of document is the second i have produced while learning how to link git and Rstudio. Hopefully i will be able to upload this document via Rstudio online

**Regards**

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
